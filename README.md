# DeepFake-Detection
Built a hybrid AI pipeline for DeepFake image detection using EfficientDet-D0 (local features), Vision Transformer (global context), and Local Gradient Analysis for noise pattern identification.

Trained and evaluated the model on the CIFAKE dataset (100K images), achieving 90% accuracy in distinguishing real vs AI-generated images.

Enhanced robustness by fusing local and global features, improving detection of subtle manipulations compared to existing baselines.
